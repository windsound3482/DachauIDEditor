# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability report it to me at this email address 
`ilyes.elmajouti@gmail.com` or make an issue to tell me about your flaw.

You could expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect 
if the vulnerability is accepted or denied, if I agree that the vulnerability 
is critical a security update will be made within the hour users and if I 
refuse your vulnerability because it is not critical there will be a branch 
with your patch note.

Thanks to you users.
